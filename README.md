## Good morning Starshine, the Earth says "Hello!" ðŸ’–

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a couple of open-source packages to make science more automated and fun. My favourite and best child is âœ¨starbarsâœ¨ (I have a favourite, of course).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything pop culture/queer related and I will never ever stop yapping.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send a message through the ether or through your closest clown friend (if that doesn't work, my mail is also [available](mailto:elide.98@gmail.com))
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/they
- âš¡ Fun fact about me: I have never once been calm in my life ever.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat!
